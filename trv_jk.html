                                    It was a very morning like time, except for the fact that it wasn't actually morning, 
                                    when we were finally ready to leave Brahmapur. 
                                    We took all of our luggage, yep we travel with pretty much a lot of luggage, 
                                    threw them back of our car which was obviously going to be driven by my father,
                                    I'm not yet an expert driver and not to mention the roads to Bhubaneswar, I don't 
                                    want to die so soon. Very much unlike our last trip, The Kerala Trip, this 
                                    time we are all pretty sure that we are prepared and nothing worth taking
                                    is left behind. And the engine ignited with a cough, or this is what it sounds like
                                    to me atleast.
                                </p>
								<p align="justify">
                                    <span class="image right"><img src="images/KashmirBlog3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                    The diversions. Oh! sorry I mean the roads, I was talking about the roads. They
                                    were quite difficult to find, to be honest. Statistically, it won't be a sarcasm to say there were
                                    more diversions to the road than the number of roads to have that many diversions.
                                    It was almost 11 O'clock in teh night as we reached there at Bhubaneswar. The plan is 
                                    we were supposed to go to Mahendra Uncle's place where we'd spend the night and early
                                    in the morning we would go to the airport, catch a flight to Srinagar. And then we remembered
                                    that we precisely don't know which way to go. Couple of moments later, I could find mysel 
                                    holding the phone while while Papa was asking the address and direction stuff. And in a while we're
									there at Mahendra uncle's. It was already late and certainly in a funny way there was no place for 
									parking our car. And some how they ended up finding a solution forthat.
                                </p>
								<p align="justify">
									We slept there, atleast everyone else and I definitely was not doing late night chatting with my
									friends, and it's morning before we realised. This is the day our journey actually starts. We, all 
									of us eight people, brushed, took a bath wore the best we could, and started off to the airport.
									And it being around my third or fourth trip where we're traveling by air, so it look less of a
									big deal to me. The same set of things just like repeated revisio before exams: boarding pass, luggage, 
									security, and board. It wasn't all that exciting untill we got into the plane, it was not my first 
									flight journey but, things like subtle simple physics behind airlift and drag and application of Bernoulli's
									theorem in all these things always manage to fascinate me, just how the speed of the airplane is creating
									the aerostatic pressure difference between top and bottom of the wings resoponsible for the airlift and all these
									nerdy things. Perfectly engineered. But I could find my sister, and probably evrey other member of our 
									company or even every other passenge, is more interested in the clouds. Apart from the fact that everything
									is ironically cheaper in the plane, there's nothing more to write about the next couple of hours
								</p>
								<p align="justify">
									The next worth noticing things were the other airports that we halted on our way to srinagar. The one at Delhi
									IGIA, is literally massive. and ther was a bit longer halt at Jammu airport, which was also an airbase. A lot of
									people alighted the plane there, and only a few more boarded the plane. It was a very high security one, lots 
									of checkings were done, even on the plane. Our next destination was Srinagar Airport. There was some lady
									by the name Junifer from the travel agency who provided us with the most of the things we might require
									including a driver, sarcastically with a half broken car to show us around Srinagar and nearby places.
