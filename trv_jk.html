                                    It was a very morning like time, except for the fact that it wasn't actually morning, 
                                    when we were finally ready to leave Brahmapur. 
                                    We took all of our luggage, yep we travel with pretty much a lot of luggage, 
                                    threw them back of our car which was obviously going to be driven by my father,
                                    I'm not yet an expert driver and not to mention the roads to Bhubaneswar, I don't 
                                    want to die so soon. Very much unlike our last trip, The Kerala Trip, this 
                                    time we are all pretty sure that we are prepared and nothing worth taking
                                    is left behind. And the engine ignited with a cough, or this is what it sounds like
                                    to me atleast.
                                </p>

                                    The diversions. Oh! sorry I mean the roads, I was talking about the roads. They
                                    were quite difficult to find, to be honest. Statistically, it won't be a sarcasm to say there were
                                    more diversions to the road than the number of roads to have that many diversions.
                                    It was almost 11 O'clock in teh night as we reached there at Bhubaneswar. The plan is 
                                    we were supposed to go to Mahendra Uncle's place where we'd spend the night and early
                                    in the morning we would go to the airport, catch a flight to Srinagar. And then we remembered
                                    that we precisely don't know which way to go. Couple of moments later, I could find mysel 
                                    holding the phone while while Papa was asking the address and direction stuff.
